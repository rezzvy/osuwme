Hii! i'm rezzvy, the creator of OSUWME, and i'm here to talk about how you can support this project!

But wait, let me yap for a bit >w<
so uhm, i made this project mostly because i wanted to simplify the "making" process for content on the osu! web. i rlly love customizing my userpage, and i know there are lots of ppl on osu! who feel the same way.

I also wanted to contribute to the community. this is my way of helping out, and i hope it solves your bbcode problems!

If you want to support the project, just use it! that's really all i ask :3
or you can help me spread the word! whenever a friend asks, "how do i do this?" or "how do i do that?" (bbcode-related), just tell them: "use osuwme!" >w<

I'm rlly open to feedback and happy to help with any bugs you find, so please feel free to text me!
