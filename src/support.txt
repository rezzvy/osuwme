Q: How can I support osuwme?
A: By using osuwme, you are already supporting it. You can also help by spreading the word, telling your friends, or recommending it to anyone who needs help with BBCode.

Q: If I log in, can you steal my password or hack my account?
A: No. That is not possible. When you log in, osuwme only requests a key (token) from the osu! API to interact with the osu! servers. This token is very limited and can only be used to read public information.

Q: Why was I suddenly logged out?
A: Currently, there is no feature to automatically renew the token, as I am still learning the full inner workings of the osu! API. Because of this limitation, the token expires and acts as an automatic logout mechanism, which also helps improve security.

Q: Do you collect my data?
A: When you are not logged in, no data is collected.

When you are logged in, some non-sensitive data is processed by the server for functional purposes, as explained below.

[Preventing abuse and spam]
Since osuwme is integrated with the osu! API, the server needs to prevent spam to avoid hitting API limits. To do this, a unique identifier is generated based on your network IP. This identifier is hashed, making it unreadable and cannot be used to directly identify you. It is only used for spam prevention.

[Improving the Clone / Auto-Sync feature]
When logged in, the server stores your public username and user ID for diagnostic purposes (for example: rezzvy | 8804560). This allows me to verify that osuwme renders your me! page correctly and to fix issues more efficiently.

[Important note]
If you are uncomfortable with this, you can use osuwme without logging in. The app works the same either way.

If you have further questions, or if you would like me to manually delete your stored username and user ID, feel free to email me at rezzvyuwu@gmail.com.
