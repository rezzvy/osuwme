Q: How can I support OSUWME?
A: By telling a friend to use this tool >.< or simply using it yourself for your BBCode needs. And if you find a bug, please post a comment on the forum!

Q: Where can I contact you if I have ideas for improvement or find bugs?
A: For bug reports, you can post a comment on the OSUWME forum thread. If you use GitHub, feel free to open an issue there. Or, if you prefer to chat with me personally, just DM me on Discord @rezzvy.

Q: If I log in, will you be able to hack me or steal my personal information?
A: Nopee, not a chance qmq... When you log in, OSUWME just asks the osu! server for a "key". I then use that key to interact with the osu! server on your behalf. This key is very limited and can only access publicly available information. I can't read your private details, and I definitely can't see or steal your password >.<

Q: Why was I logged out suddenly?
A: This happens because the key stored in your browser has expired. When OSUWME tries to use it, the osu! server refuses it, so you get logged out and need to log in again to get a new key :3 (Actually... this is just my skill issue LOL. I still don't fully understand how to implement the 'auto-refresh key' feature yet qmq)

Q: Do you collect my data?
A: Nothing is collected when you are not logged in. When using the clone/sync feature (which requires you to log in), only minimal, non-sensitive data is processed by the server after authentication. Nothing beyond that is collected. Please read the details below.

Here is the breakdown of what is collected and why:

[To prevent abuse/spam]
When you request to log in, the OSUWME server generates a unique identifier based on your network IP. This is completely safe because it is hashed (converted into an unreadable string), meaning that once it is hashed, there is no way to see the original value again, so it cannot be used to identify you in any way. I strictly use this to block spam requests and prevent the server from hitting the osu! API limits if someone tries to abuse the clone/sync feature (please don't qmq… spare me >.<).

[To find bugs and improve the OSUWME Clone/Sync feature]
When you are logged in, the server stores your public username and user ID (e.g., username: rezzvy | uid: 8804560). Using this info, I can verify if OSUWME is processing your 'me! page' correctly. If I find a bug specific to your 'me! page', this helps me fix it ASAP!

[IMPORTANT]
If you are not comfortable with this, please feel free to use the app without logging in. The core functionality works exactly the same whether you are logged in or not. 

[NOTE]
Send me an email at "rezzvyuwu@gmail.com" if you want me to delete your data from my database. No hard feelings!

[LAST BUT NOT LEAST]
Thanks if you're cool with this! Honestly, the data collected is minimal. I'm just trying to be honest and transparent about privacy stuff because I'd feel way too guilty if I didn't tell you >.<
